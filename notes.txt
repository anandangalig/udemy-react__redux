JSX - a subset of JS that lets us write html within JS
JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript.
You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant.
Just like XML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.
If an attribute value is enclosed in quotes, the value is a string.


 1. Component division can be done in any way. There is no secret sauce.
 2. Components can be nested!
 3. The modularity of components based on the functionality, is useful for re-using the same component.
 4. One component per FILE! No matter how small.

React VS Angular or Backbone: much less methods and structure to learn and use.


Working with Data/API:
* Follow the Data Down structure: the outer most component (parent) should call the data and pass it down.

function() is equal to =>
  -> aka ARROW functions
  -> fat arrow
